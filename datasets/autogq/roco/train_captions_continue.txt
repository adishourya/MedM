ROCO_60599	 Radiation treatment plan illustrating the dosimetric benefits of proton therapy in a patient with tumor near critical central structures. Prescribed tumor dose is 50 GyE in 4 fractions, with isodose line numbers displayed in units of cGyE. Significant radiation sparing of the aorta, esophagus, and lung is achieved due to the steep dose falloff of protons, while achieving appropriate target coverage for tumor cell kill. Beam angles are selected to traverse a minimal amount of lung tissue. Range differences based on the density heterogeneity of tissue traversed can be appreciated at the anterior aspect of the plan, where a peak of dose is deposited in normal lung. Careful attention must be paid to these dose variations and areas of range uncertainty such that dose tolerance of critical structures is not exceeded.

ROCO_66386	 On the same static image as Figure 1 and Figure 2. The Doppler angle is now corrected to the emission sound beam (white dotted arrow) from the transducer being parallel to the blood flow direction at the sampled interlobar artery (arrow). On remeasurement, the peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity are increased up to 42.7 cm/sec and 17.0 cm/sec, respectively, which are higher than 24.5 cm/sec and 9.8 cm/sec measured without Doppler angle correction in Figure 1.

ROCO_73538	 Suggested contribution of lytic enzymes to cell death execution of in vitro generated zinnia tracheary elements. In stage III of xylogenesis in in vitro cultured zinnia cells the tonoplast ruptures and various lytic enzymes are released from the vacuole resulting in autolytic digestion of the protoplast and DNA fragmentation. The SCWs are partially completed, nucleus is condensed. Caspase-like proteases from cytoplasm and oligonucleases (DNAse ZEN1 and RNAses) from the vacuole contribute to DNA cleavage in the nucleus; SER and CTE might be involved in proteolysis of cytoplasmic proteins; TLP might participate in tonoplast collapse and autolysis; PLCP participates in autolysis and SCW deposition; VPE—a plant caspase-1-like protease might contribute to tonoplast rupture and vacuole-mediated digestion of the cellular content; other hydrolytic enzymes might also be released from vacuole. Background image—a dead tracheary element in stage III of transdifferentiation; incomplete and completed SCWs are distinguished following Calcofluor White labelling.

ROCO_74242	 Thyroid ultrasound revealed a 14x14x22 mm nodule with a mixed echo pattern, rough calcification foci and cystic-necrotic areas in the left lobe lower pole. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of this nodule complied with benign follicular nodule. Bone scintigraphy is usually performed to evaluate a wide variety of skeletal abnormalities (1). Tc-99m-labeled diphosphonates have been used for bone scanning as a major diagnostic tool since the beginning of 1970s (2). Tc-99m MDP has rapid blood clearance, excellent in vivo chemical stability, and a high bone-to-soft tissue ratio, thus, it is ideal for bone imaging (3). In the literature, many cases of incidental Tc-99m-MDP uptake by the soft tissue have been reported due to various reasons, both benign (tumoral calcinosis, myositis ossificans) and malignant (sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, metastases) conditions (4,5). Mechanisms leading to increased extraosseous Tc-99m MDP uptake include extracellular fluid expansion, enhanced local vascularity and permeability, and high tissue calcium concentration. The composition of the calcium deposition and the presence of other elements (e.g. iron and magnesium) are important (4). It is known that there may be incidental Tc-99m MDP uptake in the thyroid gland, in calcific thyroid nodules, secondary to biopsy interventions, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma or metastatic thyroid cancer (4,6). In our case, unexpected incidental Tc-99m MDP involvement was presented in a functionally active thyroid nodule. This appearance of Tc-99m MDP uptake in an active thyroid nodule, first demonstrated in this case, is thought to be secondary to the presence of microcalcifications in the nodule

ROCO_75626	 Manual calculation of target coordinates from axial T2 weighted image with the Leksell frame. The outer fiducials of the lateral plates form a rectangle; the diagonals of this rectangle intersect at the centre of the frame. The geometry of the frame dictates that the Z (vertical) coordinate can be determined by adding 40 mm to the distance between the posterior and middle fiducial markers on the lateral fiducial plates. X (mediolateral) and Y (anteroposterior) axes are defined by lines drawn through the frame centre and parallel to the sides of the rectangle. The geometry of the frame dictates that centre of the frame corresponds to X = 100 mm and Y = 100 mm. The X and Y coordinate of any point within the image can therefore be calculated by measuring its displacement from the centre of the frame. Lateral displacements to the left are added and displacements to the right subtracted from 100 to give the X coordinate. Anterior displacements are added to 100 and posterior displacements subtracted from 100 to give the Y coordinate. In this example, a target was selected in the right STN: Z coordinate = 40 + (Z1 + Z2)/2 mm; X coordinate = (100 − X1) mm, since the target lies to the right of the frame centre. Y coordinate = (100 + Y1) mm since the target lies anterior to the frame centre

ROCO_76451	 Cross-fracture-plane structures are absent in the gecko tail.Magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyse a detached tail stump (see also Movies S1–S3). The data revealed the structures of the muscle fibers in the different segments of the gecko tail. Two areas have been encircled to point out the position of the muscle fiber termini neighbouring the autotomy fracture plane. The image illustrates the expanded nature of these termini. The presence of these “mushroom-shaped” structures in the fracture plane and the absence of these structures in the interior muscle fibers illustrate the conformational change of the muscle termini that occurs during autotomy. The interdigitating arrangement of the muscle fibers are observable and the picture also shows that no through-going structures between muscle segments are observable, thereby supporting the concept that tail segments interact by adhesion forces.

ROCO_77928	 Transatrial lead implantation in a 12 year old boy with complex cardiac malformations. He had several open heart procedures and finally in 1995 a modified Fontan procedure with the addition of a fenestrated atrial baffle was accomplished. Sick sinus syndrome with bradycardia and dizziness was diagnosed in 2001. Because of the caval pulmonary connection a venous approach for lead insertion from cranial was impossible. Therefore, after median sternotomy a bipolar screw-in lead was implanted transatrially into the venous system (1) together with a right ventricular epicardial bipolar, steroid-eluting epicardial electrode (2). The pacemaker was programmed to DDDR mode, with the AV-conduction time so long that  intermittent atrial pacemacer stimulation allowed physiologic stimulation of the ventricle. As an atrial back up lead a second epicardial bipolar steroid-eluting electrode was placed on the right atrium (3) with the lead body tunnelled to the generator pocket. In case of transatrial lead failure (e.g. exit block), revision would not neccessitate a rethoracotomy, but only an incision into the abdominal generator pocket and the exchange of the epicardial atrial lead.

ROCO_78943	 Pressure and flow compartments in the brain. Illustration of the pressure and flow "compartments" considered throughout the paper. Pressure can be measured anywhere within the cranium, and both mean pressure as well as pulse amplitude are generally considered to be position-independent. From a technical standpoint, however, pressure measurement is usually restricted to the lateral ventricles, cisternum magnum or the brain parenchyma. Flow, on the other hand, varies considerably with both magnitude (i.e., mean flow) and pulsatility strongly depending on fluid type (e.g., arterial blood vs. CSF) and on location. The figure indicates typical locations for CSF flow measurement. Blood velocity measurements (not shown) are generally restricted to the larger inlet/outlet vessels of the cranium (e.g., carotid, basilar, middle cerebral arteries, sagittal and straight sinuses).

ROCO_79073	 Example of automatic attenuation-based tube current modulation and the resulting slice selective changes of the effective dose as calculated by the dose-simulator tool.The white line indicates the scan range of CTred (reduction of scan length 26%). The DLP could be reduced by 23%, which is approximately similar to the scan range reduction, due to the proportional mathematical relationship. This also applies for the DLP derived effective dose estimation (dose reduction of 23% with an effective dose of 0.7 mSv for CTred and 0.9 mSv for CTstd.). The dose management platform calculations however revealed an effective dose reduction of only 14% (1.3 mSv for CTred and 1.5 mSv for CTstd) and the absolute effective dose values are approximately 45% higher than for the DLP derived approach. This can be explained by the fact, that the dose management platform algorithm selectively considers radiosensitive organs in the irradiated area and their individual contribution to the effective dose whereas the DLP derived approach only allows for a rough dose estimation that underestimates the actual effective dose and at the same time overestimates the relative dose reduction associated with the scan range reduction due to the underlying mathematical principles.

In the contralateral normal extremity, a few lymphatic vessels show a discontinuous outline with relatively low signal intensity (small arrows). The concomitantly enhanced vein shows a linear structure with lower signal intensity (large arrows).
