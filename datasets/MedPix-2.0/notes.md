            "Disease Discussion": "Bladder diverticula most often occur as a result of outlet obstruction.  Occasionally, a congenital weakness in the bladder wall adjacent to the ureteral orifice results in a diverticulum.  This is termed a \"Hutch\" diverticulum.\nIn children, outlet obstruction causing a diverticulum is rare and can be seen with urethral valves.  In men, diverticula are associated with outlet obstruction from urethral stricture, prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma etc.  acquired diverticula are rare in women.\nDiverticula usually occur on the lateral bladder walls, rarely the dome.  They are often multiple.  Large diverticula often displace the bladder and or ureters.  \ndiverticula can have wide or narrow necks.  The wide necked variety empty urine readily.  The narrow neck type are slow to empty and therefore are more likely to have urinary stasis.\nInfection, tumor and stone formation can occur as a result of urine stasis within a diverticulum.  Tumor formation in a diverticulum is more likely to spread beyond the bladder because the diverticulum wall consists only of urothelium without muscle.\nBladder diverticula can be evaluated with excretory urography, ultrasound, CT and cystoscopy.\n\nRef:\nDunnick, R., McCallum, R., Sandler, C., Textbook of Uroradiology.",
