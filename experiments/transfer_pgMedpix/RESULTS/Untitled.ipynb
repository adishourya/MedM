      "The most common form of meningioma described in the disease discussion is multiple attenuation pathency lesions.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The most common forms are \"globose\" (spherical) or \"en plaque\" (flat).\n",

      "answer What is the appearance of meningiomas on MRI, according to the disease discussion?\n",
      "The appearance of meningiomas on MRI is the most common extramedullary tumor, with its most frequent location being the parasagittal putamen.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "They are typically well-circumscribed and iso- to hypointense on T1, iso- to hyperintense on T2, and strongly enhancing.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "answer Why do malignant meningiomas have a higher rate of recurrence compared to benign ones?\n",
      "Because malignant meningiomas have a higher rate of recurrence because they are more likely to recur after initial surgical resection, whereas benign meningiomas have a higher rate of recurrence if they become symptomatic or develop an abnormal behavior.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Malignant meningiomas demonstrate rapid growth or intraparenchymal invasion.\n",
