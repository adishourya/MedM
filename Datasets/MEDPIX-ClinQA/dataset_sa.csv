-Macrocephaly, seizures
-Death usually occurs in 2nd year of life

Imaging Findings:
-Diffuse, symmetric involvement of cerebral white matter
-SC WM preferentially affected early
-No contrast enhancement
-MRS: Elevation of NAA
Both the NAA to choline (Cho) and NAA to creatine (Cr) ratios are increased, with relatively normal Cho and Cr.
